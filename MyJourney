Going into this assignment I never before touched Node.js, Express, EJS, gulp, or really anything other than React.
I didn't find much trouble implementing any of those expect learning how functionality was passed around in express. But
once I found that out it was pretty clear and intuitive.

The only setback I had was actually deploying the site. I spent the majority of my time on this. Github pages apparently
does not host Node.js projects, so I looked in many other places to host a page for free. I didn't find any that worked
and decided to pay the small fee for AWS since I am somewhat familiar with it. My app wouldn't deploy so I decided to take
their sample app and put my own code in there to check where the problems lie. I didn't really figure it out, but was able
to get it deployed by seemingly just having that file structure and changing the name of some files.

I had the IP location detection set up from this the same way I did zipcodes and it worked, which I was only able to test
once the site was deployed.

I planned on adding react components, but the site deployment wouldn't allow me to deploy new instances for some reason.
I was unable to figure that out and decided that because it was a bonus attribute, and my skills in react can be seen
elsewhere in my work that I would leave it out. Mostly an effort to get the project in since I held onto it for a little
while longer than average to figure out the deployment.

I designed all my Icons in Adobe Illustrator.
