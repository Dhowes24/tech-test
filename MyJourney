Going into this assignment I had never before used Node.js, Express, EJS, SCSS, or gulp. So the first hurdle I had to
pass was to learn each of those aspects. That was the majority of the time spent. What took me the most time was figuring
how to pass data and functions around the app, through app.* calls. I settled on saving all the data to app.local variables
to access once the page rendered with my partial. I had the intent to use React components to create the weather info,
along with hourly info beneath it, but my IDE would not let me set it over to React JSX, which I am comfortable with
syntactically so I dropped it as it was a bonus and my experience in React can be proven elsewhere. It was more time
constraints than anything else.

I believe I got the IP location detection to work, but could not test it. The libraries I used worked on test IPs but
when going off localhost I couldn't get the IP of my computer to test.

I would have been able to test this if I could manage a live page. I attempted to use github pages but I found the
service does not work with Node.js apps. I looked for many other ways to share a live page but each gave me a dead ends,
or discovery of services that were no longer kept up.

I am going to continue over the weekend to get the page live over the weekend and will tack onto my submission when I am
able to do so. I will also take another attempt on integrating the react components I mentioned, since I am sure no one
will be looking over this over the weekend.

I designed all my Icons in Adobe Illustrator.
